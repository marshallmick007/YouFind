Coding Problem 

Our preference is that you do your development in GitHub, so that we can clone your solution directly from there. Please ensure that cloning the repository, then running it directly (without any additional setup steps) will start the app properly. We consider this a reflection of how you work. If the application does not run, we will not be able to grade it. 

Please get your solution completed by end of day Tuesday, May 26th, 2020.  If you need more time, just let me know. 

The People Search Application 

Business Requirements 

    The application accepts search input in a text box and then displays in a pleasing style a list of people where any part of their first or last name matches what was typed in the search box (displaying at least name, address, age, interests, and a picture).  
    Solution should either seed data or provide a way to enter new users or both 
    Simulate search being slow and have the UI gracefully handle the delay  

Technical Requirements  

    A Web Application using WebAPI and a front-end JavaScript framework (e.g., Angular, React, etc.)  
    Use an ORM framework to talk to the database 
    Unit Tests for appropriate parts of the application
